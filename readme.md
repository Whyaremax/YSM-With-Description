This is a **Fork** of [YSM Model repo](https://github.com/Elaina69/Yes-Steve-Model-Repo/) but in this version, it contains description of how and what are them

Pre: What are these? 
They are either zip files or .YSM encrypted files that contain models and json file tells mod how to render the model.

How do I apply these beautiful anime skins to my character/player?
For this one, its fairly simple. If you haven't read the wiki.
You would need open up your world, Head to control and find the keybind

You can see all models you installed here, as if I already pre-installed some model.
In here, head to folder liked thingy on right top corner. You didn't see one? Check your YSM version insure the newest from [modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/yes-steve-model) **REMEBER, Its a free mod, if you see any that ask you pay, please ignore**
Click open model folder

This kind liked folder is going pop up and located at %appdata%\.minecraft\config\yes_steve_model\custom
Now download model from this repo or orginal repo, I personally suggest orignal repo as support Elain69.
Last not least click on the model you loaded, you're good to go!

What? You already **Loaded** Minecraft before install model? You don't want **Restart**?
Rejoin/Leave and load the world and then press hotkeys again, you would see models loaded

Hint: some sneaky model creator would add mutlipe model to one, like this

In that case, to check, press the shirt-liked bar button

Then you would able see all animation + models

Say you don't like the model? 
Just simple remove it!

**Notice before you leave, all model here is uploaded by Elain69 and according to I know, these are all free. If you incounter where website ask you pay for one of these model, please avoid**
